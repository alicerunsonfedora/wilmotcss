                    Instant messaging, in its current state, is a bit messy. A lot of people are using (and often juggling between) different centralized services and apps to communicate with family, friends, coworkers, and other people; examples include Facebook Messenger, Android Messages, Skype, and even iMessage. While having a multitude of services isn't inherently bad in and of itself, it presents a lot of issues: data between users is stored and collected onto servers owned by the service provider, which may lead to privacy and backdoor issues such as targeted advertising, third parties using your data for unintended uses, and even tracking from parties or governments. These services also aren't able to communicate between each other as easily, making it difficult to move from service to another. Simply stated, there isn't a viable standard for instant messaging that benefits everyone. How ever, the developers at the Matrix Foundation have been working diligently to solve this issue by creating a new, open, and decentralized standard for instant messaging communications called Matrix, which also provides this ability to bridge between services. Through Matrix's technical capabilities and France's adoption of it as their standard for instant messaging between government departments and to the French public, Matrix will play an important role in the world of instant messaging as the primary standard protocol.
